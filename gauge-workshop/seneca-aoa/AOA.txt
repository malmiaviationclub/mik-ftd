Angle of Attack proof of concept gauge for the web panel.

Tuomas Kuosmanen <tuomas.kuosmanen@gmail> & Malmi Aviation Club, October 2014.

This is rough and hardcoded to the seneca.

  * It assumes the critical angle of attack to be 15 degrees (scale = 4)
    so it works on the SenecaII. This could be likely done generic, or 
    in any case needs to be adapted to the aircraft in question. The 
    "red line" is 60 degrees, so adjust your scaling accordingly.
    so your critical AOA matches the redline (15*4 = 60).

  * The negative alpha scale is not calibrated at all, I guess
    the obvious thing to do is to make the gauge face match the 
    negative critical alpha of the aircraft, or then again, it could
    be just gray, as in "this is not really meant for inverted flight
    guidance".. :-)

  * A web gauge was easiest as proof of concept, this could also be
    done as a real xml gauge for the virtual cockpit and fgpanel.
