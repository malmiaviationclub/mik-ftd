*** OH-TWN simulator project files ***

Mostly this is just a custom instrument panel intended to run a separate screen. 

Usage:

1. Put Panel1Protocol into your "Protocol" folder inside fgdata.

2. run fgfs --generic=socket,out,24,localhost,34200,udp,Panel1Protocol &

3. Symlink the "OH-TWN"-folder next to the other aircraft in fgfs.

3. run fgpanel --panel=Aircraft/OH-TWN/Panels/Panel1.xml
   --fg-root=/path/to/fgdata


TODO:
   - the protocol needs to be reviewed, likely some properties are
     missing and also some are likely not used. Make sure we actually transmit the 
     variables/values we use.
