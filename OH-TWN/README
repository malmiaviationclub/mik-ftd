OH-TWN Flight Simulator 
=======================

This project exists to develop a flight training device based on FlightGear 
flight simulator. Requires FlightGear 2.4 or later to work, the required 
fgpanel application is not necessarily part of the official windows build 
of flightgear.

This is based very heavily on the work of Torsten Dreyer in the SenecaII panel. 

PANEL - see Panel-folder.

  This is a custom fullscreen instrument panel for the SenecaII aircraft in flightgear.

  Usage:

  1. Put Panel1Protocol into your "Protocol" folder inside fgdata.
  2. Symlink the "OH-TWN"-folder next to the other aircraft in fgfs.
  3. run fgfs --generic=socket,out,24,localhost,34200,udp,Panel1Protocol
  4. run fgpanel --panel=Aircraft/OH-TWN/Panels/Panel1.xml --fg-root=/path/to/fgdata

TODO:
   - the protocol needs to be revised, as it is just the one from SenecaII 
     trainer panel. Likely some properties are missing and some are likely 
     not used. Make sure we actually transmit the variables/values we use.
