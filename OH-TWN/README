OH-TWN Flight Simulator
===========================================================================
This is a Malmi Aviation Club (www.mik.fi) project to develop a flight
training device based on FlightGear. You probably should first read
http://wiki.flightgear.org/FGPanel and also the readme file inside
flightgear/utils/fgpanel to get started with external panels if you
want to use this for something.
===========================================================================

This is based on / inspired by the work of Torsten Dreyer in the
SenecaII panel.

PANEL - see Panel-folder.

  This is a custom fullscreen instrument panel for the SenecaII
  aircraft in flightgear.

  Usage:

  1. Put Panel1Protocol into your "Protocol" folder inside fgdata
  2. Symlink the "OH-TWN"-folder next to the other aircraft in fgfs
     aircraft folder.  
  3. Run fgfs with protocol output parameters:
     --generic=socket,out,24,[ip-addr],34200,udp,Panel1Protocol
  4. Start fgpanel with --panel=Aircraft/OH-TWN/Panels/Panel1.xml
  --fg-root=/path/to/fgdata

  TODO:

   - The protocol file needs to be checked, as it is just the one from
     SenecaII trainer panel. Likely some properties are missing and
     some are likely not used. Make sure we actually transmit the
     variables/values we use.
